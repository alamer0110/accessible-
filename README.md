# header-- 
* we we can add Landmark rules for the code, it's a way to provide navigational landmarks for people using accessibility tools like screen readers.we can add role = "banner" for the header.

* we can describe the logo by adding alt="more information" to the <img> code to have more information for the accessibility. 
*  we can give the links some focus (a :focus{outline: 3px solid #any colour we want}) to make it clear and to know where we are know in which link. it will make the website more attractive and also we can skip link if we add the focus, we can give the links the href ="where we want it to scroll" and we should give for example the main or the the footer id to go directly there. 
* we should add role ="navigation" to the <nav>. 


# main--
+ list item 1 : we can add role = "main" to the <main> like what we should do in the header and the footer. 

+  we can give the button a hover to make it more attractive. 
+  we can change the colour for the paragraph to make it more accessibility.
+ we can add alt="" for the <img> in main to give more information and aslo we can add <img aria-details=""> so we can point more elements  , we should add in the <dl><dt> id with same name we gave it to the aria-details , we can also make it hidden to make the website more clean. 
+ it's better to change the color for the table to make the information more clear or we can give the table class and add overflow: hidden if we don't need them to show in the website. 
+ we can change the color for the paragraph to make it more clear. 
+ the text under the paragraph
# footer--
